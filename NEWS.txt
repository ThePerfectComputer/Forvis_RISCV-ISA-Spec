### November 1, 2018:

- Now booting RV32 FreeRTOS.
- Added support for 'F' (single-precision floating point)

### July 24, 2018:

- Now booting an RV64 Linux kernel! Try it! See the README.

### June 2018:

- Complete rewrite, encapsulating full semantics of each instruction
    in its own function, which can be read standalone, and using even
    more elementary Haskell.
- Now handles RV32 and RV64 simultaneously.
- Named it 'Forvis'
