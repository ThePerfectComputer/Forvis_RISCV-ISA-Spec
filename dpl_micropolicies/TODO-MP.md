* TODAY

figure out if the "no applicable rule" failure is what we should expect

replace Shrinking stuff with Leo's updated version
  and get it working
  and remove / hide the old micropolicies directory

merge in Nikhil's master 

move the Stack stuff into the dpl directory

beautify the code so others can use it

________________________________________________________
* SOON

Falling off the end of memory is not a very interesting behavior --
generate it less often or maybe explicitly look for it and halt
execution

Try to write an explicit test that exercises the second mutant

there are too many magic constants saying how many instructions to
generate / execute!

are we generating too many "interesting" immediate fields?

delete policy-* when finished using them for reference

________________________________________________________
* LATER

start thinking about stack safety!
  - look at the policy in the draper repo

haskell-mode for emacs!  (on BCP's work laptop)
